/**
 * A bull-headed brute: slow, heavy, hard to stagger and hard to run from. Where an Orc is a
 * skirmisher that might throw instead of close, the Minotaur has exactly one plan -- walk at you
 * and hit you with whatever is in its fist. It trades the Orc's reach and variety for weight:
 * higher health and armor, real knockback resistance, and an attack that throws the target back.
 *
 * <p>Equipment is data-driven the same way the rest of GMM does it -- the weapon comes from the
 * consumer-populated {@code gmm:minotaur/weapons} item tag, so the library ships no item of its
 * own. An empty pool leaves the Minotaur bare-fisted, which is a legitimate look for it (see
 * {@link #populateDefaultEquipmentSlots}), unlike the Orc, whose empty hands mean "thrower".
