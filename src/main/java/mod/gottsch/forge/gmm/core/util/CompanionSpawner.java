/**
 * Public, imperative companion-placement API. {@code GMMMonster#getCompanionPool()} /
 * {@code GMMFlyingMonster#getCompanionPool()} use this internally to drive their own tag-driven,
 * spawn-time-triggered escorts, but it's equally meant to be called directly by a consumer that
 * already knows exactly which companion(s) it wants for one specific occasion — e.g. a custom
 * structure/room spawner that places a single mini-boss and wants a hand-picked escort alongside it,
 * with no general "this mob type always gets companions" rule involved at all.
 *
 * <p>Every companion is finalized with {@link MobSpawnType#MOB_SUMMONED} — deliberately not
 * {@code NATURAL}, so a companion can never itself trigger the tag-driven auto-spawn path (that check
 * only fires on natural/egg/command spawns, never {@code MOB_SUMMONED}). Calling this method directly
 * carries the same guarantee: whatever a caller spawns through here is inert as far as the auto-spawn
 * system is concerned, so mixing manual calls with the tag-driven system is always safe.
