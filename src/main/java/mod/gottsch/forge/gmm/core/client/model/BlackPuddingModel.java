/**
 * A single body cube, built to vanilla slime's exact dimensions ({@code 8x8x8} at {@code -4,16,-4}) so
 * the Black Pudding sits in the ooze family's silhouette alongside {@code GelatinousCube},
 * {@code OchreJelly} and {@code GrayOoze} — which all reuse vanilla's {@code SlimeModel} directly.
 * <p>
 * This mob needs its own model class rather than reusing {@code SlimeModel} for one reason: <b>the
 * lash</b>. It is drawn procedurally by {@link TendrilRenderer} rather than being cuboid geometry,
 * because a stretched {@code ModelPart} can only ever be a straight line and this one whips out along
 * an arc. It appears only while striking, and only on an adult ({@code BlackPudding#hasLash}), so the
 * strike itself is the tell that this pudding out-reaches you.
 * <p>
 * Earlier passes hung extra cuboids off the body — four corner "tendrils", then a pair of trailing
 * slime shapes plus a blob on the leading face. All were tried in game and cut: the tendrils read as
 * legs poking through the floor, and the trailing slime did not read as slime. The mob is
 * deliberately a plain black cube whose only distinguishing feature is what it does, not what it
 * grows. Do not reintroduce decorative geometry without testing it in the client first.
 * <p>
 * No translucent outer layer, unlike the rest of the family: a black pudding is opaque, and vanilla's
 * {@code SlimeOuterLayer} is hard-typed to {@code SlimeModel} anyway.
