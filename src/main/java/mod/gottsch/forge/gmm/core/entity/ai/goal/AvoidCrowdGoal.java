/**
 * Keeps a mob from getting boxed into a knot of other mobs <em>while it is engaging a target</em>.
 * Meant for a "leader" type (the Skeleton Champion) that should hover at the edge of its own pack
 * rather than in the middle of it, so a player's sweep / AoE / stray swing doesn't catch it in the
 * scrum. Purely positional — it never drops the target and never runs from the player; it just steps
 * to open space and lets its minions form the front line.
 *
 * <p>Algorithm, each time it fires (throttled): gather the mobs crowding the leader, build a
 * repulsion vector that points away from them (nearer mobs push harder, ~1/distance), ask the
 * pathfinder for a reachable spot in that direction, and reject the spot if it would pull the leader
 * out of engagement range of its target. If a valid spot is found, walk there. Because it only holds
 * the {@link Flag#MOVE} flag and sits at a higher priority than the attack goal, it preempts the
 * approach when the leader is crowded and yields to it (attacks) once the space is clear.
