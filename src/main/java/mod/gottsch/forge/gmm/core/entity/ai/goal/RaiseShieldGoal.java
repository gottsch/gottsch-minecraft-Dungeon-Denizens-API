/**
 * Raises whatever's equipped in {@code EquipmentSlot.OFFHAND} (checked to actually be a
 * {@link ShieldItem} -- this goal never equips anything itself, see each consumer mob's own
 * {@code populateDefaultEquipmentSlots}) whenever a live, visible target is within {@link #range},
 * and lowers it again once the target backs off, breaks line of sight, or {@link #maxBlockTicks} of
 * continuous blocking elapses. A short cooldown after lowering keeps it from instantly re-raising.
 * <p>
 * Deliberately claims no {@link Goal.Flag}s: raising a shield doesn't stop the mob from moving,
 * so this runs <em>concurrently</em> with {@code MeleeAttackGoal}/ranged attack goals rather than
 * instead of them (adding {@code MOVE}/{@code LOOK} flags would keep it from ever running while the
 * mob is in combat, which is the opposite of what's wanted).
 * <p>
 * The shield does <em>not</em> stay up through an attack, however: the instant the mob swings its
 * mainhand, {@link #canContinueToUse()} drops the goal so the shield lowers, and the {@code stop()}
 * cooldown ({@code cooldownTicks}) then gates how soon it can re-raise -- a mob can't block and swing
 * in the same instant, and there's a brief usage cooldown after every lower.
 * <p>
 * The actual damage reduction isn't anything this goal implements -- calling
 * {@code startUsingItem(OFF_HAND)} alone is enough to make vanilla's own generic
 * {@code LivingEntity#isBlocking()}/{@code isDamageSourceBlocked()} kick in (that logic was never
 * player-locked), including its front-facing-only requirement -- so a mob has to actually be facing
 * its attacker for a raised shield to matter, same as a player.
