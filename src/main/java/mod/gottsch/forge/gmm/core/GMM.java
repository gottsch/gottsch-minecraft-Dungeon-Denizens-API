/**
 * gottsch's Monster Manual (gmm) is a pure base-class library, NOT a content mod.
 * It deliberately registers no EntityTypes, items, or other game objects of its own.
 * Instead it supplies reusable base mob classes, AI goals, models, renderers, textures,
 * and helpers. Consuming mods (e.g. Village Dungeons, Dungeon Denizens) depend on gmm
 * and register their own EntityTypes (villagedungeons:rat, dungeondenizens:rat, ...),
 * reusing the gmm-namespaced assets. One-off mobs may register in their own mod while
 * still contributing their model/renderer/texture back to this library for reuse.
 * <p>
 * The only registrations are <em>infrastructure</em>, not game content: a datapack registry
 * ({@link GMMRegistries#MOB_CONFIG} -- gmm defines the registry + codec but ships no entries;
 * consumers supply the JSON) and default {@link GMMSounds} SoundEvents (a registered SoundEvent is
 * required to be playable; the matching {@code .ogg} assets ship in gmm, and mob classes use them as
 * an overridable default). Neither adds mobs, items, or other world content.
