/**
 * A {@link MeleeAttackGoal} that strikes from further away than the mob's hitbox would normally allow —
 * for a monster whose reach comes from a limb rather than its body: {@code BlackPudding}'s tendril
 * lash, and (planned) the Roper/Reaper grapple tentacle.
 * <p>
 * <b>This class exists because overriding {@code Mob#getMeleeAttackRangeSqr} does not work.</b> That
 * looks like the obvious hook, and it is what other vanilla code paths consult, but in 1.20.1
 * {@link MeleeAttackGoal} never calls it — its own {@code getAttackReachSqr} recomputes the range
 * inline from {@code mob.getBbWidth()}, so a {@code Mob}-level override is silently ignored and the
 * mob keeps attacking at its default range. Verified against the 1.20.1 bytecode. The only way to
 * widen the range this goal actually uses is to override the goal's own method, which is what happens
 * here.
 * <p>
 * The bonus is supplied rather than fixed so it can be read live from a mob's config, and so a mob can
 * return zero when it should not currently have the reach at all (a Black Pudding's split children
 * have no tendrils, so they get no lash and no extra range).
