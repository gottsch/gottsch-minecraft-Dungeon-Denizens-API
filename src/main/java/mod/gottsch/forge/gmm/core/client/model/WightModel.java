/**
 * The Wight rig: the shared {@link GMMZombieModel} zombie rig, but without the shambling-zombie arm
 * pose — a Wight kept its wits (and its fighting stance), so it swings its arms like a normal
 * humanoid combatant (walking swing + attack swing, both already computed by
 * {@link net.minecraft.client.model.HumanoidModel#setupAnim} before {@link #animateArms(Wight, float)}
 * would otherwise override them) rather than lurching with its arms thrust forward.
 *
 * <p>While {@link Wight#isCasting()} (Summon/Enthrall charging up, synced from the goal via
 * {@code ICastingMob}), both arms instead raise into a channeling pose with a gentle waving
 * oscillation, so the cast is visibly telegraphed rather than the Wight just standing still.
