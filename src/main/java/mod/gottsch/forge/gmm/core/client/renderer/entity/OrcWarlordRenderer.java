/**
 * The Orc Warlord: the orc rig at 1.2x, in the chief's colours.
 *
 * <p>Extends {@link OrcRenderer} and re-bakes {@code OrcModel.LAYER_LOCATION} rather than declaring
 * a layer of its own &mdash; the warlord is an {@link Orc} and uses the orc geometry unchanged, so a
 * second {@code ModelLayerLocation} would be a second thing to register for no difference in what is
 * drawn. It also means a consumer registering this renderer needs no extra layer registration, which
 * is the failure mode that crashes on first sight of the mob rather than at load.</p>
 *
 * <p>1.2x, matching what SkeletonChampion does to a skeleton: the chief has to read as the leader
 * across a room, and colour alone does not carry at distance. {@link OrcWarlord#getStandingEyeHeight}
 * applies the same factor so the eye line follows the render.</p>
