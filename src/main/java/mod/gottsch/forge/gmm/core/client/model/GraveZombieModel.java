/**
 * The Grave Zombie rig: the shared {@link GMMZombieModel} shamble with a phase-driven "digging" pose
 * swapped in for the two transitions. The whole rig — every part, moved together as one rigid unit,
 * not via independent per-part rotations (which read as a broken/twisted pose) — sinks fully below
 * the ground plane while buried and rises back up as it surfaces, with a small uniform positional
 * jitter layered on top for a "struggling to dig out" shudder. Arms additionally blend from
 * thrust-straight-up to the normal shamble pose as it rises (and the reverse on the way back down).
 * {@code riseAmount} (0 = fully buried, 1 = fully risen) is fed in by {@code GraveZombieRenderer} each
 * frame, partial-tick interpolated — the same trick {@code BloodyBonesModel#collapse} uses for its own
 * rise animation.

    // plane), so 32 is the exact depth that drops the crown of the head to ground level. The extra 2
