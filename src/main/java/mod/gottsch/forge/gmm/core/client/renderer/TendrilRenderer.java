/**
 * Draws a tapered, optionally arcing tube between two points — the shared geometry behind every
 * "limb that reaches much further than its body" in GMM: {@code BlackPudding}'s tendril lash, and
 * (planned) the Roper/Reaper grapple-and-reel tentacle.
 * <p>
 * This exists because {@code ModelPart} cannot do it. Stretching a cuboid via {@code zScale} gets you
 * length, but only in a straight line and only by smearing the texture along it; a tentacle that
 * <em>arcs</em> would need a long chain of hand-posed bones to fake badly. Generating the vertices
 * instead makes length, taper and curvature all continuous parameters, at the cost of the geometry no
 * longer being editable in Blockbench — which is the right trade for a limb whose whole shape is
 * computed at runtime anyway.
 * <p>
 * Deliberately <em>not</em> the beacon-beam render type. That one is full-bright and translucent,
 * which suits magic and suits nothing here: these are wet physical limbs that must be lit by the same
 * lightmap as the body they grow out of. Callers pass the {@code VertexConsumer} they were already
 * handed, so the tube shares its parent's texture, render type, lighting and overlay — a hurt flash
 * reddens the tentacle along with the mob, for free.
 * <p>
 * Endpoints are taken per call rather than baked, so a caller may either fire and forget (a strike
 * that snaps out and retracts) or track a live, moving target every frame (a grapple that reels its
 * victim in).
 * <p>
 * <b>Coordinates are in model units</b> — the same 1/16-of-a-block units {@code ModelPart} takes, with
 * Y pointing down — so a caller can position this against its own cuboids without converting. The
 * division into block space happens in {@link #vertex}, exactly as {@code ModelPart.Cube.compile}
 * does it. Omitting that conversion is silent and total: the geometry still builds correctly and
 * throws nothing, but lands sixteen times too far out and sixteen times too large, which in practice
 * puts it underground and off-screen. That mistake cost a full debugging session on 2026-08-24.
