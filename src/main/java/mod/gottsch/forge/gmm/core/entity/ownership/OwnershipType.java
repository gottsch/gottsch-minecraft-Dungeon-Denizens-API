/**
 * The <em>kind</em> of relationship an owned mob has with its owner, layered on top of the owner UUID.
 * <p>
 * An "owner" in GMM is any entity that spawns, summons or conjures another entity. The type decides
 * the extra behavior the ownership carries:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #NONE} -- not owned (default for a natural spawn).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #REINFORCEMENT} -- owner is recorded for lineage/allegiance, but the mob is otherwise a
 *       normal, permanent spawn that targets whoever it likes (vanilla zombie-reinforcement style).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #SUMMONED} -- a temporary conjuration: it may assist its owner and it has a lifespan,
 *       after which it is "unsummoned" (vanishes). E.g. a wizard summoning a demon for a set time.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #THRALL} -- a mob under the owner's command that obeys issued orders (guard, follow,
 *       attack, stay).</li>
 * </ul>
