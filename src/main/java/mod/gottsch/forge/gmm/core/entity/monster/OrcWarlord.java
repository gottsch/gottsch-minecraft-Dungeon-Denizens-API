/**
 * The war-chief of an orc band: an {@link Orc} that leads rather than swings first.
 *
 * <p>Three things, and they are one fight rather than three abilities. He <strong>calls</strong>
 * reinforcements ({@link #summonMobs}); he <strong>rallies</strong> what arrives &mdash; a periodic
 * Strength + Speed refresh over a data-driven ally set; and he <strong>alerts</strong> that same set
 * the moment he acquires a target, so spotting the chief is being spotted by the whole warband. He
 * also keeps to the <em>edge</em> of his own troops so a player's sweep or AoE catches the grunts
 * instead of him (see {@link AvoidCrowdGoal}).</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why this extends Orc rather than GMMMonster</h2>
 * <p>Not convenience: {@code OrcModel.setupAnim} casts its entity to {@link Orc} to read the
 * shoulder-pad / hair / bracer bits, so a warlord that were not an Orc would crash the renderer on
 * first sight of one. Extending also inherits the cosmetic roll, the data-driven weapon and the
 * ranged-throw option for free, which is the whole reason the warlord looks like <em>its own
 * warband's</em> leader rather than a different monster wearing red.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Where it diverges from SkeletonChampion</h2>
 * <p>The rally and the crowd-spacing are the Champion's, deliberately &mdash; same cadence, same
 * {@code gmm:mob_config} keys. Two pack leaders behaving by different rules would be two things to
 * learn for no gain, and the Champion's numbers have been played.</p>
 *
 * <p>The <strong>summon and the alert are what make him his own mob</strong> rather than a reskin.
 * The Champion's identity is that he improves what is already in the room; the Warlord's is that he
 * makes the room busier. Without them the two are mechanically the same monster.</p>
 *
 * <h2>What a consumer must do, and both halves fail SILENTLY</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #summonMobs} &mdash; a {@code public static} the library leaves null, exactly like
 *       {@link Orc#projectileLauncher}. Unset, the horn goal is never added and the chief simply
 *       never calls anyone. No warning, nothing in the log.</li>
 *   <li>{@link GMMTags.EntityTypes#ORC_WARLORD_RALLY_ALLIES} &mdash; gmm ships this EMPTY, because
 *       gmm registers no entities and its datagen can only name vanilla ids. Unpopulated, both the
 *       rally and the alert reach nothing.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>A warlord with neither is a slightly tough orc that looks like a boss. Both are one line each
 * in a consumer's setup, and neither announces its absence &mdash; which is the whole reason they
 * are listed here rather than left to be discovered.</p>
