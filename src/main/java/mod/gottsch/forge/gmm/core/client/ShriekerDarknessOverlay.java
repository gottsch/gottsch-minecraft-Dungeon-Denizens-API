/**
 * Draws a capped-opacity black screen overlay while the local player has
 * {@link GMMMobEffects#SHRIEKER_DARKNESS}, in place of vanilla {@code MobEffects.DARKNESS} -- vanilla's
 * own Darkness shader always ramps to full peak opacity while active with no partial-intensity control
 * (amplifier doesn't change how dark it gets, only duration changes how long it lasts), which read as
 * "absolute blindness" rather than the oppressive-but-not-total dark the user asked for.
 *
 * <p>The target opacity is decoded from the effect instance's own amplifier (0..100, reconstructed to a
 * 0..1 fraction below) rather than a hardcoded constant here -- {@code Shrieker} encodes its
 * {@code gmm:mob_config}-driven {@code darknessOpacity} into the amplifier when it applies the effect
 * (see that class's {@code triggerAlert}), the same "repurpose an existing numeric field to carry data"
 * trick {@code GMMParticles.SLIME_TRAIL} already uses for its own RGB tint. This overlay class itself
 * stays fully generic -- it never references {@code gmm:mob_config} or any consumer namespace, it just
 * decodes whatever amplifier its own registered effect happens to carry.
 *
 * <p>No fade-in: the darkness snaps to its target opacity the instant the effect lands (reads as
 * "startled by a shriek," matching the sound cue landing at the same moment) and fades back to normal
 * over the last {@link #FADE_TICKS} of the effect's remaining duration -- computed purely from
 * {@link MobEffectInstance#getDuration()} (ticks remaining), since a {@code MobEffectInstance} doesn't
 * retain its own original total duration once applied, so a symmetric fade-in would need extra
 * bookkeeping this effect doesn't need for the fade-out-only shape it actually wants.
